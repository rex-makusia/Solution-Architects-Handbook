# The Meaning of Solution Architecture

## What is a solution Architect ?

- Each organization may see solution architect from a different perspective, based on their business needs, organizational hierarchy, and solution complexity.
- In a nutshell, solution architect can be described as defining and foreseeing multiple aspects of business solution, from both strategic and transactional perspectives. "Strategic means
  that a solution architect defines a long-term vision for a software application to ensure it stays relevant, regardless of future changes, with possible extension  to address increasing
  user workload and additional feature demand. "Transactional" means an application should handle the current customer workload and address daily business challenges without any issues.
- Solution architecture is not just about providing a software solution. It covers all aspects of a system, which includes, but is not limited to, system infrastructure, networking, security,
  compliance requirement, system operation, cost and reliability.

A good solution architect address the most common aspects of the Software solution in an organization:

- **Globally distributed teams:**
- **Global compliance requirement:**
  - The **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)** and **Department of Defence Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide(DoDSRG)** for USA
  - The **General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)** for Europe
  - The **Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP)** for Australia
  - The **Center for Financial Industry Information Systems(FISC)** for Japan
  - The **Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS)** standard for Singapore
  - The **G-Cloud** for the UK
  - The **IT-Grundschutz** for Germany
  - The **Multi-Level Protection Scheme(MLPS)** Level 3 for China
- Complance requirements are different between industries: for example, the **International Organization for Standardization(ISO) 9001** for healthcare, life sciences, medical devices ,the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS)** for finance and the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)** for healthcare.
- **Cost and budget**: Solution architect gives a good estimation of the overall cost of the project, which helps to define a budget.
- **Solution implementation component**: Solution architect provides a high-level overview of different implementation components of the product beforehand, which helps to plan execution.
- **Business requirements**: Solution architect considers all business requirements, both functional and non-functional.
- **IT infrastructure requirements**: Solution architecture determines what kind of IT infrastructure is required to execute the project.
- **Teachnology selection**: During the design, a solution architect creates a prototype, which considers the corporate requirements, and then recommends the right technology and tools for implementation. 
- **End user requirements**: Solution architecture pays special attention to the requirements of the end user who will be the actual consumer of the product. 
- **Solution maintenance**: Solution architect is not just about solution design and implementation, but also take care of post-lauch activities, such as solution scalability, disaster recovery, and operational excellence.
- **Project timeline**: Solution architecture designs the layout details of each component with their complexity, which helps to define the project milestones and timeline by providing resource estimation and associated risks.

And industry-standard and well-define solution architecture addresses all business requirements within a technical solution and make sure to deliver the desired resullt in order to satisfy  the stakeholders, as per their expectation in terms of quality, availability, maintaiability, and scalability of the solution.

The initial design of a solution architecture may be conceived at a very eary stage during the pre-sales cycles, such as **request for proposal (RFP)** or the **request for information(RFI),**and is followed by the creation of a prototype or proof of concept, in order to
discover any solution risk. The solution architect also identifies whether to build a solution or to source it. It helps to identify the 
appropriate technology, while also keeping an organization's critical security and compliance requirements in mind.

There are two primary situations for creating a solution architecture:
- First, enhancing technology for an existing application, which may include hardware refresh or software re-architecting.
- Second, creating a new solution from the ground up, where you get more flexible to choose the best fit technology to address a business requirement.

A good solution architecture not only satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements but also address system scalabilities and maintenance in the long run.
