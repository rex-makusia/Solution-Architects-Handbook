# The Meaning of Solution Architecture

## What is a solution Architect ?

- Each organization may see solution architect from a different perspective, based on their business needs, organizational hierarchy, and solution complexity.
- In a nutshell, solution architect can be described as defining and foreseeing multiple aspects of business solution, from both strategic and transactional perspectives. "Strategic means
  that a solution architect defines a long-term vision for a software application to ensure it stays relevant, regardless of future changes, with possible extension  to address increasing
  user workload and additional feature demand. "Transactional" means an application should handle the current customer workload and address daily business challenges without any issues.
- Solution architecture is not just about providing a software solution. It covers all aspects of a system, which includes, but is not limited to, system infrastructure, networking, security,
  compliance requirement, system operation, cost and reliability.
